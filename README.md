Tyson Fury vs Oleksandr Usyk – aka Ring of Fire – for the undisputed world heavyweight title is as monumental a fight as is possible in boxing. For the first time since Lennox Lewis in 2000 — and the only time in the four-belt era — one person will own every strap in the sport's blue riband division. This is potentially the biggest PPV fight in historysdfgg

The build-up has already turned ugly. Tyson Fury's father, John, risked being sent home from Saudi Arabia after he headbutted a member of Oleksandr Usyk's entourage at a media event. The video has gone viral.

Unlike his old man, Tyson Fury looks in better shape than ever coming into the fight. Slow, ponderous and having clearly overlooked novice challenger Francis Ngannou last time out, the 35-year-old Gypsy King 35-year-old will look to use his size and reach advantages to dominate Usyk physically and detonate some of the fierce shots that caused Deontay Wilder so many problems.fdgfhg

Usyk is tantalisingly close to making history as the first man to become undisputed at two different weights, having unified the cruiserweight division in 2018. The Cat has since beaten Derek Chisora and Anthony Joshua (twice) and most recently stopped Daniel Dubois last August. Will Usyk be able to live with the extra power Fury is going to bring?dfgfhg

Fury brings the WBC title to the fight, while Usyk has the WBA, IBF, and WBO belts in his possession. The winner will be the first man to become undisputed heavyweight champion in the four-belt era.

Patrick Stumberg will be on the round by round call in the stream below starting from Noon ET, and we’ll have full highlights, results, and more as the show goes on. Join us for one of the biggest days in boxing this year!

Heavyweight champions Fury and Usyk fight for all four belts this Saturday in Saudi Arabia. The fight was supposed to take place in February but was pushed back three months after Fury was forced to pull out after being cut in sparring. Tempers have boiled over just one day after Usyk landed in the Kingdom as a member of his team clashed with Fury's dad John.

Hey Heavyweight rivals have been on a collision course for more than a year having initially been pencilled in to clash at Wembley last April. Terms could not be agreed on that occasion and the fight was pushed back until two days before Christmas, only for Fury's life-and-death fight with Francis Ngannou to put a spanner in the works.

Tyson Fury will fight against Oleksandr Usyk in a heavyweight clash for the WBA, WBC, WBO, and IBF titles on Saturday, May 18, live on Sky Sports Box Office. This 12-round heavyweight title clash will occur in Saudi Arabia and is expected around 11 PM UK and Ireland time, i.e., 3:30 AM the next day in India. This fight will title the first undisputed heavyweight champion after Lennox Lewis defeated Evander Holyfield in 1999.

Tyson is 35, and Oleksandr is 37. Fury is English-born and has a record of 34-0-1 (24 KOs), and Usyk is Ukrainian-born and 21-0 (14 KOs). You can watch the fight on Sky Sports; let us dive deep into it.

Fury and Usyk agreed to push their meeting back until February 17 only for the Brit to suffer a cut above his eye in one of his final sparring sessions. A new date was quickly agreed with both men now in Saudi Arabia ahead of Saturday night's showdown. Here is everything you need to know about the clash...

Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk will likely walk to the ring at around 11pm UK time on Saturday night, which will be 1am in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. But as fans experienced when Anthony Joshua fought Francis Ngannou in March, the first bell could ring after midnight in the UK, meaning a late night for fight fans. The ultimate start time will depend on how long the undercard fights take to complete. The first fights of the day will start at around 2.45pm in the UK with the official undercard kicking off at 5pm.

If you were expecting plenty of bombast and explosive turns of phrase at Thursday's final press conference for Tyson Fury vs Oleksandr Usyk – especially after headbutt-gate earlier in the week – then you would've been disappointed. Both fighters couldn't have been less perfunctory if they tried. This was strictly business.

Neither Fury, nor Usyk, gave much away with both dedicating their full attention to Saturday's massive fight.

"I'm ready. I've got nothing else to say apart from I'm ready for a good fight," said Fury, adding he'd "say a prayer for [Usyk] before the fight for us both to get out of the ring safely".

Usyk was barely any more garrulous. "Let's make history. Enough. Thanks very much," said the Cat.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the press conference was the traditional face-off. Unlike the usual dead stares facing each other, Fury instead turned 90 degrees to look out at the audience, while Usyk looked at the Gypsy King's left shoulder. Could this be a bit of Fury mind games ahead of the fight? He certainly knows this will be his biggest test since Usyk's compatriot Wladimir Klitschko in 2015.dfgfhg

Arguably the most interesting were the promoters and trainers. SugarHill Steward, who trains Fury, spoke at length about his uncle training Lennox Lewis to the last undisputed world heavyweight title fight back in 199, while Usyk promoter Alex Krassyuk quoted British poet Henry Longfellow. All in a day's work in boxing.dfghgh

You may have to part with a tasty wedge of your hard-earned cash to watch a Tyson Fury vs Oleksandr Usyk live stream, but there's plenty more than that mouthwatering main event to enjoy for your money.fdgfhgjh

Indeed, there are two other world title fights in addition to the big one. Firstly, it's Jai Opetaia vs Mairis Briedis for the vacant IBF cruiserweight world title, a contest between of the division's biggest names. The other scrap for gold sees Joe Cordina defend his IBF super featherweight world title against Anthony Cacace.dgfhg

There are more up-and-coming names on a stacked undercard, with Sergey Kovalev, Isaac Lowe, Mark Chamberlain (rarely in a bad fight), Moses Itauma and Frank Sanchez all in action.fdghgh

When Lennox Lewis beat Evander Holyfield by unanimous decision in 1999, nobody could have imagined that a quarter of a century would pass before a fighter unified the heavyweight division again. Tyson Fury puts his WBC title on the line and Oleksandr Usyk lays down his WBA (Super), IBF and WBO belts at Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Saturday, with the winner guaranteed a prime position in boxing's Hall of Fame.

After these two fights are over, the card will turn to pay-per-view on DAZN and PPV.com at 12 p.m. ET and will have a main event between Fury and Usyk to determine the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.

Riyadh, Saudi Arabia – In the days leading up to their undisputed heavyweight title fight, Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk seemed relaxed and eager to soak up the occasion, even as their camps taunted each other and clashed.

The biggest drama came early in the week, when Fury’s father, John, headbutted a member of Usyk’s entourage. But both the fighters had stayed light-hearted throughout the build-up – good-naturedly teasing each other, and grinning and showboating in their open workouts.

Fury, who sported a flame-coloured suit and a black trilby hat, is normally a garrulous and flamboyant figure renowned for his trash talk. But the 35-year-old British boxer also had little to say on Thursday.

“I’m ready. I’ve got nothing else to say apart from I’m ready for a good fight,” he said.

“God bless him,” he added when asked if he had a message for Usyk. “I’ll say a prayer for him before the fight for us both to get out of the ring safely.”

Boxing has long frustrated fans with various belts and sanctioning bodies creating multiple champions at the same weights, and frequent disputes over money and clashing egos often prevent the best fighters from facing each other in their prime.

Although Fury vs Usyk has taken some taken to materialise and was postponed from its original date in February after Fury suffered a cut in training, the fact that a bout of this magnitude is finally happening – partly a result of growing Saudi influence in the sport – means many are billing it as the fight of this century, with the winner stepping into the ranks of the all-time greats.

On Thursday, chants by rival fans quickly petered out into the sweltering night as locals looked on quietly. Drones fizzed overhead as spotlights illuminated swirling dust, and gusts of wind buffeted the microphones on stage.

The host of the news conference tried and failed to draw more words from the fighters. When they stood for the traditional face-off, Fury refused to even look at his rival, flexing his biceps and gazing into the crowd, while Usyk stared at Fury intently, a smile playing on his lips.

“[This fight is] of monumental importance for the history of the heavyweight division, for boxing’s value,” combat sports analyst Luke Thomas told Al Jazeera a few days ahead of the fight.

“People always complain people don’t know who the champions are. Well, now they’re going to know. And they’re going to know in the most storied division in boxing.”
